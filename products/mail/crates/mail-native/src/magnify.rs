//! Trackpad pinch → JS mail zoom in the Tauri WKWebView.
//!
//! WKWebView often swallows magnify events (especially over nested iframes),
//! so the browser-side gesture/ctrl+wheel listeners never see them. An AppKit
//! local event monitor catches NSEventTypeMagnify and re-emits the same
//! `mail-pinch-scale` CustomEvent the web UI already consumes.
