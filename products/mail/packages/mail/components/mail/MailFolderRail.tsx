 * The folder rail: every folder on every mailbox, down the left of the list.

 * It replaces a dropdown that had to be opened, read, and dismissed for
 * each filing. A rail is open or it is not, and while it is, filing a
 * conversation is one motion — pick it up, drop it on a folder already in
 * front of you. That only works if the folder is on screen before the drag
 * starts, which is the whole argument for a rail over a menu.
 *
 * Top to bottom:
 *
 *   Sent · Drafts · Trash · Junk   one set, across every mailbox
 *   ★ Favourites                   folders pinned here, mailboxes mixed
 *   Filter folders…                narrows the sections, not the views
 *   one headed section per mailbox, each a real tree
 *
 * The order is the argument. The four views at the top are the same four
 * for everybody and never move. What is below them is the reader's own
 * filing, which is theirs and is different on every machine.

        rather than left to the grid. Stacked, they run in the order they
        are spoken about: Inbox, Sent, Drafts, Trash. Two abreast, the pair
        that holds mail stands on the left and the pair you write from on
        the right — so the grid is dealt Inbox, Sent, Trash, Drafts, and
        reads down as Inbox/Trash and Sent/Drafts.

        Junk is not among them. It is a folder the reader visits rarely and
        the providers hide from the tree, so it lives in the folders menu
        beside the list, and in the move menu, where filing something as
        junk is what it usually means.
