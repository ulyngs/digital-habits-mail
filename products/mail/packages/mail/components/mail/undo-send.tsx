 * A few seconds between pressing Send and the message leaving.
 *
 * The composer closes at once, because the reader is finished with it, and
 * the message is genuinely not sent yet — nothing has been handed to the
 * provider until the count runs out. That is what makes Undo honest: it is
 * not a recall, and nothing has to be taken back from anybody.
 *
 * The cost of that is a message held in this window. If the app goes away
 * inside the count it has not been sent, so a pending send is flushed when
 * the page is hidden or closed rather than dropped. Each caller also keeps
 * what it needs to put the reader back where they were: the reply composer
 * has its outbox entry, and the main composer still has its local draft,
 * which is only deleted once the mail is actually away.
 *
 * Not offered in the chat pop-out. That window is a conversation being had,
 * where a message is a line of talk and the reply is immediate.
