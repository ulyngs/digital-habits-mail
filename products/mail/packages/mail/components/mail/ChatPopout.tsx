/**
 * Floating chat window for one mail thread ("pop out" from the mail client).
 * Rendered by the /mail-popout route inside a small always-on-top Tauri
 * window (see src-tauri open_chat_popout) or a browser popup. Two states:
 *  - expanded: chat bubbles + composer (560pt tall)
 *  - collapsed: a pill with avatar/name/subject; a green badge counts
 *    messages that arrived since the thread was last seen (72pt tall)
 * The OS window is resized to match via resize_chat_popout / resizeTo.
 *
 * Messages render through the thread reader's own MailBubble, so HTML
 * bodies, inline images, quoted-text folding, and attachments behave
 * exactly like the main mail client.
