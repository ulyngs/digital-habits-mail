 * Connecting is slow and mostly invisible: the planner leaves the page for the
 * provider's sign-in, and the desktop app waits on a browser window somewhere
 * else. Without this a click looks like nothing happened, and the natural
 * response to that is to click again.
 *
 * On a host that navigates away, `startMailConnect` never settles and the
 * button stays busy until the page is replaced. That is the wanted behaviour,
 * not a leak: there is no "after" to reset for.
