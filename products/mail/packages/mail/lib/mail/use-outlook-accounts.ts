 * message and sends it, with no field for a send time, and there is no
 * other call that will make one. Exchange has a message property for
 * exactly this (PR_DEFERRED_SEND_TIME — see `lib/outlook/api`), so the
 * server holds the message and sends it itself with nothing of ours
 * running.
 *
 * Which is why this cannot be widened without building a scheduler: with
 * no provider to hold the message, something of ours has to be awake at
 * the send time.
