 * are folded in — remembered on the row as `alsoIn`, so that whatever is
 * done to the row can be done to every copy. Deleting only the row's own
 * copy left the other to take its place on the next refresh, the same
 * subject in the same spot; the reader deleted again, and by then the
 * selection had moved on to a conversation they never meant to touch.

/**

 * reader wrote — but two ids, and the conversation is queried across the
 * whole mailbox, so both came back and the thread showed the message twice,
 * side by side, both drawn as outgoing because both are from the reader.
 *
 * Gmail never did this: it keeps one message and hangs both SENT and INBOX
 * on it. So the same account, cc'd to itself, read correctly on one provider
 * and doubled on the other — which is the part that made it a bug rather
 * than a choice. This is what makes the two agree.
 *
 * Order is kept, and the first copy of a message wins. Which one that is
 * does not show: the two are the same words from the same sender at the same
 * moment, and `own` is read off the From address, so they draw identically.
 *
 * A message with no Message-ID stands for itself. Some mailboxes have one,
 * and folding those together by a missing key would hide real messages.
