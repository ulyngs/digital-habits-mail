 * Draw the whole app at the reader's size.
 *
 * Two ways, and which one is not a matter of taste.
 *
 * In the desktop app the webview has a page zoom of its own — the same
 * thing Cmd-+ does in Safari — and that is what is used. The browser
 * rescales the CSS pixel itself, so `100vh` is still the window, a menu's
 * position is still where its button is, and nothing in the app has to know
 * the number. The first version of this used CSS `zoom` on the document
 * instead, and it looked right at a glance and was wrong in two ways at
 * once: the shell was told to be `100vh` tall, which zoom does not scale,
 * so at 120% it hung a fifth below the sill; and every popover was placed
 * by a library that measured in one pixel space and painted in another, so
 * the settings panel opened to the right of its button and its foot was
 * off the screen. What each engine returns under CSS zoom differs, and
 * there is no version of the arithmetic that is right in all of them.
 *
 * In a browser — the demo, the planner's mail page — there is no page zoom
 * to ask for, so CSS zoom is what there is, with the height corrected by
 * hand. Menus there may sit a little off at sizes other than 100%. A reader
 * in a browser has Cmd-+, which is the real thing.
