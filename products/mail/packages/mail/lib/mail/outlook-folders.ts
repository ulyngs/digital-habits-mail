/**
 * Outlook folders, in the shape the Mail UI wants.

 * The UI keys a folder by one name and treats `/` as nesting, because that is
 * how Gmail writes a nested label. Outlook has a real tree of folders with
 * ids, so this module flattens that tree to `Parent/Child` paths on the way
 * out and resolves a path back to a folder id on the way in.
 *
 * A folder whose own display name contains `/` makes its path ambiguous. Such
 * a folder still lists; only a later lookup by that path can miss, which reads
 * as "Folder not found" and changes nothing in the mailbox.
