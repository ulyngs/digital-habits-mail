/**
 * The storage boundary for mail.
 *
 * Mail states the operations that it needs. Each host implements them:
 *
 * - The planner implements them against the team Postgres, as today.
 * - The standalone product implements them against local SQLite, through
 *   Tauri `invoke`.
 *
 * Do not add a `query()` method here. Every data module in the mail package
 * starts with `import "server-only"`, and the standalone product has no server.
 * Those modules cannot run there in any SQL dialect. The operation is the seam.
 *
 * This file has no runtime imports, so any host can read it.
 *
 * Migration state: `listSync` only. See `docs/mail-product-plan.md` for the
 * remaining modules and the order to take them in.
