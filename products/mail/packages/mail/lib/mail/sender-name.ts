/**
 * The name on the mail we send.
 *
 * Gmail's API sends the `From` header we write, and we wrote the bare
 * address. Mail from this app therefore arrived headed `ulrik@example.org`
 * while the same person's mail from Gmail's own web page arrived headed with
 * their name — in every client, for every recipient.
 *
 * The name is not ours to invent. Gmail already holds one, per address they
 * can send as, set in their own settings; it is the name their colleagues
 * know them by and the name every other client puts on their mail. We read
 * that and use it. A second name kept only here would silently disagree with
 * the one on their phone, and nobody would think to look here for why.
 *
 * Outlook never had the problem: Graph's `sendMail` fills the sender in from
 * the mailbox itself, so we send it no `From` at all.
 *
 * No React and no DOM here, so a suite can read it.
