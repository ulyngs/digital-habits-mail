/**
 * The name we put on mail from an account.

 * messages Mail sent and on no others, so the same person would appear under
 * two names depending on which client they happened to use. Nobody wants
 * that, and the provider already owns the answer.
 *
 * See `@/lib/mail/sender-name` for the formatting rules.
 *
 * Kept beside the other per-account settings, with what the provider said and
 * when we last asked. The stored copy is what the send path reads, so the
 * common case costs nothing; the provider is asked again once a day, and an
 * account that answers with an error keeps the name we already had rather
 * than losing it.
