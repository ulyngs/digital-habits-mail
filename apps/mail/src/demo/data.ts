/**
 * A mailbox that does not exist, for screenshots.
 *
 * Every person, address, company and word here is invented. Nothing is
 * copied from a real mailbox, and nothing may be: these pictures are meant
 * to be published, and the same rule the test fixtures live under applies
 * with more force to something that ends up on a website.
 *
 * Two things make that more than an intention:
 *
 * - **Every address is on the `.example` top-level domain**, which RFC 2606
 *   reserves and nobody can register. No address here can reach or belong to
 *   a real person, ever.
 * - **Every name alliterates**, and most of them are Danish for something
 *   silly: Egon Egern is a squirrel, Jens Jordbær a strawberry, Gustav
 *   Gulerod a carrot, and the arts centre is called the Rabbit. A name that
 *   merely sounds plausible always belongs to somebody somewhere; a cast
 *   running down the alphabet in matching initials belongs to nobody, and
 *   reads in a published picture as the joke it is.
 *
 * A suite holds both of these — see tests/demo-mode.
 *
 * The dates are relative to whenever the app is started, so a screenshot
 * taken next month still says "10:12" and "Yesterday" rather than a date
 * from the day this file was written.
