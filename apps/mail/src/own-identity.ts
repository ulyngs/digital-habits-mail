/**
 * Whose mailboxes these are, for a build with no server.
 *
 * The planner reads this from server environment, which is right there: one
 * deployment, one reader. This product ships as a file. A build-time value
 * would be the *builder's* identity, compiled into every copy — hand the app
 * to someone else and it treats your addresses as theirs, strips your mail
 * from their replies, and files your colleagues as their colleagues.
 *
 * So it is stored, next to the mailboxes, and read when the app starts.
 *
 * Connected mailboxes always count and are never stored here: you connected
 * them, so they are yours, and they change on their own. Only the extras go in
 * — aliases that are never connected, and org domains, which stay empty unless
 * the reader genuinely has an organization.
