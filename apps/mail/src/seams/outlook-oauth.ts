/**
 * Microsoft token refresh for the standalone product.
 *
 * The mail core asks for an access token whenever it talks to Graph. The
 * planner's version reads a client id and secret from the server environment,
 * which this build has neither of. It uses the app's own public client instead,
 * the same one that connected the mailbox, and sends no secret at all: Entra
 * refuses one from a public client.
 *
 * The request goes through Rust, not `fetch`. Entra refuses a token request
 * that carries an `Origin` header, and a webview sends one on every call. See
 * `../token-request`. This applies to a refresh as much as to the first
 * exchange, so getting it wrong here would break every mailbox an hour after it
 * connected.
 *
 * Only `refreshMicrosoftAccessToken` is needed. The rest of the planner's
 * module belongs to a flow that runs on a server.

 *
 * A refused grant must say `invalid_grant`, because that is what marks a
 * mailbox as needing to reconnect. Anything else reads as a temporary fault and
