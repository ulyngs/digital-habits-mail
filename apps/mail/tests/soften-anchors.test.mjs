/**
 * Which links the reader is allowed to paint.
 *
 * Every link in an email becomes a span before the parser runs, so that an
 * `<a>` wrapping a table survives (HTML5 forbids it, and the parser would
 * hoist the table out and leave the button dead). The cost is that a span
 * inherits: a link the sender never styled came out with no colour and no
 * underline, and read as ordinary words — which is how a Zoom link pasted
 * into a message ended up looking like text.
 *
 * So a link the sender dressed keeps what it was given, and one they left
 * alone is marked here and painted by the frame's own stylesheet. Getting
 * that the wrong way round turns a "View message" button into teal
 * underlined text on its own background.
