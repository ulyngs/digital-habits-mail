/**
 * Pictures embedded in an Outlook message body.

 * A body writes `<img src="cid:something">` and the bytes come as a separate
 * inline attachment. The reader drops a cid: image it cannot resolve, so
 * picking the wrong attachments here does not show a broken image — it shows
 * a hole where the picture was, with nothing to say why. That is what a
 * forwarded phone photo looked like before this existed.

  // answered with 400, both callers caught that and carried on with nothing,
  // and so an Outlook mail with a file showed no file and one with a picture
  // in the body showed a gap. Nothing about that said anything was wrong,
  // which is why the query is checked here rather than left to be noticed.

  // --- Which messages are even looked at ----------------------------------
  //
  // `hasAttachments` is false when a message carries nothing but inline
  // parts. That is Graph working as designed, and Microsoft's own advice is
  // to read the body for a cid: source instead. Gating the search on
  // `hasAttachments` meant a picture dropped into a message and sent to
  // Outlook was never looked for, and the mail arrived empty. A picture
  // attached the ordinary way was fine, which made it look like a rendering
