/**
 * Whose mailboxes these are. Two distinct notions:
 *
 * - **Own personal address**: one of the reader's own mailboxes. These are the
 *   addresses stripped from reply and reply-all recipients, and the ones
 *   labelled "You".
 * - **Own org address**: the reader, or a colleague on the same domains. Used
 *   to keep colleagues out of CRM contact indexes and to spot outbound mail.
 *   A shared mailbox on an org domain (`team@`) is org but not personal:
 *   replies must still reach the colleagues who read it.
 *
 * **This is configuration, not a constant.** It was a hardcoded list of one
 * person's addresses until August 2026, which meant the product only behaved
 * correctly for him: everyone else's replies quoted themselves and nobody was
 * ever labelled "You".
 *
 * Personal addresses default to the mailboxes that are connected — you
 * connected them, so they are yours — and a host can add more for aliases that
 * are never connected.
 *
 * Org domains default to **nothing**, and that default matters. Deriving them
 * from the connected mailboxes would make `gmail.com` an org domain for most
 * people, and every Gmail user in the world a colleague. Only a host that
 * genuinely has an organization sets them.
