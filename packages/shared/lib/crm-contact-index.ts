/**
 * The contact index types, shared by the planner and by mail.
 *
 * Mail classifies list rows against this index, so it needs the shape. It must
 * not need the planner module that builds one: a build without the team layer
 * has no CRM at all, and a type import that points into the planner stops such
 * a build from compiling.
 *
 * The planner re-exports these from `lib/plan/crm-contacts`, so one definition
 * serves both, and no copy can drift.
 *
 * This file holds types only. It has no imports and no runtime code.
